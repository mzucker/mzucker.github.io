Turns out, sometimes a hammer is *not* the best tool for the job.

Overview
========

So in my [last post], I haughtily dismissed [SAT] as burdensome and
opaque formulation for solving puzzles like Flow Free. Since then I've
learned a few things thanks to [@asmeurer], whose thought-provoking
[comments] pointed me towards some interesting sources on the topic.

To succinctly summarize the previous post, I wrote an automated solver
for the popular Flow Free mobile puzzle app in C, based on tree
search. Although you can naturally frame Flow Free as a
[constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)][csp], I wrote that I preferred
tree search instead, because:

>  1. I spent years in grad school coding up search-based planners with A\*.
>  2. When you have a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.

The program I presented ended up running pretty quickly, solving all of the
puzzles in my test suite in under 1.6 seconds per puzzle, while weighing
in in at 1,910 physical lines of C code.[^1]

And that would have been the happy ending to the story, had asmeurer's
comments not prodded me to try out the CSP/SAT solution. The [new
program][github], written in Python, has a worst-case solution time of about
0.4 seconds on my test cases, using *3x less code* than the C
solver.[^2]

Background
==========

As I recently learned, dependency resolution is another problem that
can also be posed as either graph search or as SAT.[^3] In a nutshell,
the objective is to decide what additional packages to install or
uninstall when a user wants to run some desired piece of software. The
figures below, from [this paper][OPIUM], show how dependency/conflict
relationships between packages can be represented in both ways:

![Dependency resolution as SAT](/images/flow-sat/opium.png){: .center-image .border }

Indeed in 2013, the Python distribution [Anaconda]
switched its [conda] package management tool to [resolving
dependencies using SAT][condasat], thanks to developer Ilan Schnell. The
underlying engine is the C-based [PicoSAT] solver, made accessible
from Python by Schnell's [pycosat] module. As a warm-up to solving the
dependency problem, he used pycosat to write a
[Sudoku solver][sudoku], which was a helpful and instructive example
as I began writing my pycosat-based Flow Free solver.

Conjunctive normal form
=======================

The thorniest part of reducing a general CSP to a SAT problem is that
the constraints must typically be expressed in
[conjunctive normal form (CNF)][cnf]. CNF consists of a number of
OR-clauses, all of which must be satisfied conjunctively (i.e. they are
all AND-ed together). Each OR-clause is a disjunction over one or more
[literals] consisting of single logical variables or their negations.

Converting to CNF can be a bit tricky: the logical statement $$x
\leftrightarrow y$$ (i.e. "$$x$$ and $$y$$ are either both true or both
false") gets represented as the two clauses

$$
\begin{align}
(x \lor \lnot y) \land (\lnot x \lor y)
\end{align}
$$

whereas the Boolean exclusive-or (XOR) of the two variables, $$x
\not \leftrightarrow y$$, must be represented as

$$
\begin{align}
(x \lor y) \land (\lnot x \lor \lnot y) 
\end{align}
$$

Logical implications like $$x \rightarrow y$$ become the single clause
$$(\lnot x \lor y)$$, and negations of AND-clauses such as $$ \lnot (x
\land y ) $$ (that is, "it is not the case that both $$x$$ and $$y$$
are true") are straightforwardly converted through [DeMorgan's law] to
$$(\lnot x \lor \lnot y)$$.

Reducing Flow Free to SAT
=========================

With this basic understanding of CNF, we're ready to begin reducing
Flow Free to SAT. By the way, the discussion in this section pretty
much follows the recipe for a SAT-based solver outlined in the
[StackOverflow answer] I linked to in my last post, but it fills in a
*lot* more details that I had to figure out on on my own.

One by one, we will see how to encode the following list of
constraints into CNF:

 - Every cell is assigned a single color.
 - The color of every endpoint cell is known and specified.
 - Every endpoint cell has exactly one neighbor which matches its color.
 - The flow through every non-endpoint cell matches exactly one of the
   six direction types.
 - The neighbors of a cell specified by its direction type must match its color.
 - The neighbors of a cell *not* specified by its direction type must
   *not* match its color.
   
Let's define some variables and indices to get started. Say that our
puzzle has $$N$$ cells and $$C$$ colors. We will use $$i$$, $$j$$,
$$k$$, $$\ldots$$ to refer to to individual cells, so for instance we
have cell $$i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$$. Similarly, we will use the
indices $$u, v \in \{1, \ldots, C\}$$ to refer to individual colors.
Finally, we can define six "direction types" that specify which of a
non-endpoint cell's neighbors are connected to it by some flow (we can
conveniently illustrate them with
[Unicode box drawing characters][unibox]). The six types are:

|--
| Direction type | Unicode char | Description
| :-: | :-: | :--
| 1 | `─` | left-right 
| 2 | `│` | top-bottom
| 3 | `┘` | top-left
| 4 | `└` | top-right
| 5 | `┐` | bottom-left
| 6 | `┌` | bottom-right
|==

We will use $$t \in \{ 1, \ldots 6 \}$$ to index these direction
types.  With that setup in mind, let's address the first constraint on
our list above.

**Every cell is assigned a single color.** We will create $$N \times
C$$ Boolean variables to encode the color of each cell: if the SAT
solution sets $$x_{i,u}$$ to true, that means that cell $$i$$ has
color $$u$$. These color variables are handled slightly differently in
endpoint cells (i.e. the colored dots that are initially filled in
before the puzzle is solved) and normal free cells. Let's consider
normal cells first.

Clearly every cell must have *some* color, so for each non-endpoint
cell $$i$$, we can write the clause:

$$
\begin{align}
(x_{i,1} \lor x_{i,2} \lor \ldots \lor x_{i,C})
\end{align}
$$

Also, for each non-endpoint cell $$i$$, we know that no two color
variables can be true, so we get the clauses:

$$
\begin{align}
( \lnot x_{i,1} \lor \lnot x_{i,2} ) \land 
( \lnot x_{i,1} \lor \lnot x_{i,3} ) \land 
( \lnot x_{i,1} \lor \lnot x_{i,4} ) \land 
\ldots \land
( \lnot x_{i,1} \lor \lnot x_{i,C} ) & \\

( \lnot x_{i,2} \lor \lnot x_{i,3} ) \land 
( \lnot x_{i,2} \lor \lnot x_{i,4} ) \land 
\ldots \land
( \lnot x_{i,2} \lor \lnot x_{i,C} ) & \\

( \lnot x_{i,3} \lor \lnot x_{i,4} ) \land 
\ldots \land
( \lnot x_{i,3} \lor \lnot x_{i,C} ) & \\

\phantom{( \lnot x_{C-1,2}} \vdots \phantom{\lnot x_{p-1,C} )} & \\

( \lnot x_{C-1,2} \lor \lnot x_{C-1,C} ) & \\

\end{align}
$$

Each one of these comes from negating the AND clause $$x_{i,u} \land
x_{i,v}$$ for two different colors $$u$$ and $$v$$. Note we have
$$C(C-1)/2$$ possible combinations of two colors for each cell.

**The color of every endpoint cell is known and specified.** Since
their colors are specified initially, for each endpoint cell $$i$$, we
know its *true* color $$u$$, so we can simply assert the clause
$$(x_{i,u})$$. We can also specify that none of the other colors are
present, so $$( \lnot x_{i,v} )$$ for all $$v \ne u$$. 

**Every endpoint cell has exactly one neighbor which matches its
color.** This is the neighbor through which a flow originates or
terminates.  Let us assume endpoint cell $$i$$ has known color $$u$$
and neighbor cells $$j$$, $$k$$, $$l$$, and $$m$$. Since at least one
neighbor of the cell has color $$u$$, we can write the clause

$$
\begin{align}
( x_{j,u} \lor x_{k,u} \lor x_{l,u} \lor x_{m,u} )
\end{align}
$$

Furthermore, no two neighbors of the endpoint cell $$i$$ both share
its color, so we have $$(\lnot x_{j,u} \lor \lnot x_{k,u})$$, and all
the other two-way combinations of the neighbors (i.e. $$j$$ and $$l$$,
$$j$$ and $$m$$, $$k$$ and $$l$$, and so on).

**The flow through every non-endpoint cell matches exactly one of the
six direction types.** Now, for each non-endpoint cell we introduce up
to six Boolean "direction type" variables that specify which two
neighbors of the cell are connected to it along a solution path. If
variable $$y_{i,t}$$ is true in the SAT solution, then some flow
connects cell $$i$$ to the two of its neighbors specified by type
$$t$$ from the table above. Note that some cells can not assume all of
the direction types -- for instance, it is impossible for a flow to
have the `┘` direction type anywhere in the top row or leftmost column
of the puzzle (since those cells are missing the required neighbors
above or to the left).

Just like the color variables, we can generate clauses for the
direction variables to ensure that:

 - every non-endpoint cell cell has at least one direction type, and
 - no two directions types are specified for any non-endpoint cell.
 
The former gives us one clause per cell; the latter gives up to 15
additional clauses -- one for each possible pair of direction types present.

**The neighbors of a cell specified by its direction type must match
its color.** It's time to consider the interaction between direction
type variables and color variables. Each direction type picks out two
neighbors of a cell; for example, direction type `┐` selects a
cell's left neighbor and its bottom neighbor. So for any cell $$i$$
and any direction type $$t$$ applied to it, we get two
neighbors $$j$$ and $$k$$ that must have the same color as cell
$$i$$. That means, for all colors $$u$$:

$$
\begin{align}
    y_{i,t} \rightarrow \big( ( x_{i,u} \leftrightarrow x_{j,u} ) \land
     ( x_{i,u} \leftrightarrow x_{k,u} ) \big)
\end{align}
$$

...bearing in mind that the indices $$j$$ and $$k$$ are jointly
determined by the cell $$i$$ and the direction type $$t$$. Massaging
the statement above into CNF gives us four clauses:

$$
\begin{align}
    (\lnot y_{i,t} \lor \lnot x_{i, u} \lor x_{j, u}) \\
    (\lnot y_{i,t} \lor  x_{i, u} \lor \lnot x_{j, u}) \\
    (\lnot y_{i,t} \lor \lnot x_{i, u} \lor x_{k, u}) \\
    (\lnot y_{i,t} \lor  x_{i, u} \lor \lnot x_{k, u}) \\
\end{align}
$$

**The neighbors of a cell *not* specified by its direction type must
*not* match its color.** This is the constraint that prevents path
self-contact.  For any neighbor $$l$$ of $$i$$ which isn't picked
out by direction type $$t$$, we can say $$y_{i,t} \rightarrow \lnot (x_{i,u}
\land x_{l,u})$$. In CNF, this becomes the clause

$$
\begin{align}
    (\lnot y_{i,t} \lor \lnot  x_{i, u} \lor \lnot x_{l, u}) \\
\end{align}
$$
    
**...That's it!** We just generated quite a few variables and clauses:
our puzzle of size $$N$$ with $$C$$ colors has $$NC$$ color variables
and about $$6 N$$ direction type variables, with $$O(NC^2)$$ clauses
over just the color variables and an additional $$O(NC)$$ clauses for
direction-color interactions. You may recall that SAT runtimes are, in
the worst case, exponential in the number of variables. Should we be
worried about prohibitively slow solution speeds?
[*Spoiler alert:*](#conclusions) nope.

Dealing with cycles
===================

One point that got raised in the [StackOverflow answer] is that this
particular reduction to SAT does not prevent freestanding cycles from
arising in the puzzle. Here's an example -- on the left below, we have
the initial state of a 14x14 puzzle, and on the right, an invalid
solution with a cycle (the 2x2 yellow square in the top left):

![initial state and solution with cycle](/images/flow-sat/cycles-bad.svg){: .center-image }

Let's double-check whether this obviously bogus solution meets our
constraints from before:

 - Every cell is assigned a single color. ✓
 - The color of every endpoint cell is known and specified. ✓
 - Every endpoint cell has exactly one neighbor which matches its color. ✓
 - The flow through every non-endpoint cell matches exactly one of the
   six direction types. ✓
 - The neighbors of a cell specified by its direction type must match its color. ✓
 - The neighbors of a cell *not* specified by its direction type must
   *not* match its color. ✓

Unfortunately, the cycle really *is* allowed. Like the StackOverflow
commenter, the only way I can think to prevent them in the SAT
specification would be to add O(N^2) additional variables to track
whether each cell is rooted the starting point of some flow. I tried
going down this path, and it really bogged down the PicoSAT solver.

Instead of adding the extra "rootedness" variables, my program works
*incrementally* by detecting cycles in the SAT solver's output and
emitting additional clauses to prevent them. For instance, in response
to the bogus solution on the right above, it would add a clause saying
"either cell (4, 3) is not `┌` or (4, 4) is not `┐` or (5,4) is not
`┘` or (5, 3) is not `└`". In other words, it is not the case that all
four cells have the direction types causing the cycle.

In the case of this particular puzzle, having been prohibited from
forming the yellow cycle above, the incremental solver happily
discovers one more cycle (left below) before finding the true solution
(right):

![another cycle and solution](/images/flow-sat/cycles-again.svg){: .center-image }

It turns out that this kind of incremental solution of SAT problems,
where the solver is invoked multiple times as variables and clauses
are added, is an application area of sufficient interest that it now
merits its
[own category at the yearly SAT competition][incremental].[^4]

Conclusions {#conclusions}
===========

As the table below shows, although the C solver is faster than the
SAT-based Python solver on most puzzles (especially small ones), the
worst-case solution time for the Python solver is much better. Looking
at the time differences between them, the maximum in favor of the C
solver is 0.356 seconds, on `jumbo_14x14_01.txt` -- the only puzzle in
the test suite that actually necessitates cycle detection and
repair. On the other hand, the maximum difference in favor of the
Python solver is 1.197 seconds on the slowest puzzle for the C solver,
`jumbo_14x14_30.txt`.

Add to that the fact that the Python program has far less code than
the C version, and SAT starts to look really appealing. I'm going to
close off this post with another screen grab of a Facebook exchange
that I think really captures the learning experience of this week's
exercise:
