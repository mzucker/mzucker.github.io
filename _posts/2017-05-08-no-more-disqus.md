Commenting on the blog is disabled until further notice due to ads.

In February, Disqus
[wrote about some changes](https://blog.disqus.com/our-plans-for-2017)
to their service that could potentially include advertising for free
users like this blog. Rather than inadvertently serving ads, I decided
to archive the existing comments and cease using Discus.

As of today, the old comments are back up, complete with dates & links.
