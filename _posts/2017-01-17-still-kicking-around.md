Nope, I didn't fall off the face of the earth; I just have a full-time
job.

Regular readers of the blog may have noticed a prolonged hiatus in
posts. This pesky thing called "real life" keeps rudely intruding on my
blogging career. The good news is, I love my job -- especially the
people-centric parts of it -- even when it steamrolls me. The bad news
is, it's going to take me a while to empty the pipeline of planned
posts, which presently includes more puzzle solving, computer
graphics, and computer vision. Regular posting should get easier in the summer once the academic year ends.

In the meantime, let me offer a small morsel to tide you over: [a repost of a tutorial on Perlin noise][pertut] that I wrote as a
college student almost exactly 16 years ago.

As the disclaimer in the linked document states, it is entirely
outdated at this point. Curious readers interested in a modern
treatment of procedural noise for computer graphics would do much better to 
start out by looking through Inigo Quilez's [articles][iqarticles] and
[demos][iqdemo].

Despite its obsolescence, my 2001 article is still linked (via the
Wayback Machine) on the 
[Wikipedia page for Perlin noise][wikiperlin][^1], and it even has a [handful of citations on Google Scholar][scholarcites]. My favorite part of the entire thing is
the set of figures I lovingly created, pixel-by-pixel, in MS Paint, like this one:

![oooh, MS paint, looks totally professional](/html/images/repeatposneg.png){: .center-image}

The motivation for unearthing this piece was a request from a programmer in the process of assembling [his own documentation][lars] on the topic, who found it helpful despite its age. 

I had fun going back and rereading it. Hope you enjoy it, too!
