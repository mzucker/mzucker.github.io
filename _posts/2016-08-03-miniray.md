title: A minimal raytracer
---

How my quest to make a business card sized raytracer got a little out of hand.

As an aside, this ended up being a very long post. If you get bored,
you can just [skip to the end](#appendix) where I've presented all of
the version history side-by-side with the program outputs, or just
go [browse the github repo](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray).

*Update Aug 24, 2016:* The cards have [arrived](#card)!


Background
==========

At some point during grad school (probably around mid-2009), I
happened across [Andrew Kensler's business card sized
raytracer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~aek/code/), which produces this
amazingly beautiful image in just 1,337 ["leet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) bytes of C++ source:

![aek](/images/miniray/aek.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

Aside from the obvious reflections, the program is notable for its
depth-of-field blur and soft shadows.[^1] When I learned that Kensler's
program was itself an homage to a previous business card sized
raytracer created by [Paul Heckbert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/), I
decided to create my own.

[^1]: Fabien Sanglard did [an admirably thorough analysis](http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/) of Kensler's program in 2013, long after the 2011 IOCCC.

Objective
=========

Like Kensler, I wanted my raytracer to write my name or initials;
however, I thought I could improve the text rendering by using a
vector font, as opposed to a raster font as Kensler's did. My goal was
to use "ball-and-stick" letters composed of piecewise arcs and line
segments to spell "mattz".

One immediate obstacle arose: the result of sweeping a 3D sphere along
a 2D arc is a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) segment,
and ray-torus intersection a bit hairy because it requires solving a
quartic (fourth-order polynomial). Analytic solutions to general
quartics
[exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#General_formula_for_roots),
but they're complex enough to spill the program way over the size of a business card.

Fortunately, I had recently come acros Inigo Quilez's nvscene 2008
presentation, [Rendering Worlds With Two
Triangles](http://iquilezles.org/www/material/nvscene2008/nvscene2008.htm),
which supplies a convenient dodge: raymarching, a.k.a. sphere
tracing. Here's an illustration of the process, from iq's slides:

![Gratuitously taken from iq's nvscene 2008 PDF](/images/miniray/raymarch.gif){: .center-image .halfwidth }

Sphere tracing works by computing or estimating the distance between
the current point on the ray (initially the ray origin) and the
nearest point in the scene, and advancing along the ray by that
distance, as shown above. Although it may be slower than analytic
raytracying, it is numerically robust and guaranteed to converge to an
intersection as long as the ray starts in free space and the distance
estimate is less than or equal to the true distance.[^2] 

[^2]: These days, raymarching/sphere tracing forms the basis of the vast majority of the shaders on [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com), which was founded and popularized by none other than [Quilez himself](https://shadertoy.com/user/iq). I have a [bit of a presence there, too](https://shadertoy.com/user/mattz).

While analytically intersecting a ray and torus is hairy, computing
the [exact distance between a point and a
torus](http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm)
is a piece of cake, and it admits a straightforward solution to
clamping the angle to obtain arcs of less than 360&deg;.

Initial development
===================

So after playing a bit with distance functions and fonts, I whipped up
[version
0.1](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_0.1.cpp)
of my business card raytracer, which produced this image:

![v0.1 not so impressive](/images/miniray/miniray_0.1.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

The image was not so impressive (poor composition, no background), and
the code was nearly twice as long as Kensler's, at 2,245 bytes[^3];
however, it did successfully render my name in a proportional vector
font with some nice Phong-like shading. The overall strategy for
encoding the text led to a somewhat compact representation, and
remained remarkably well-preserved throughout the entire development
of the program even as the encoding got smaller and smaller. 

[^3]: Not the size of the raw file; C/C++ file sizes reported here are computed by the [format_and_count.py](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/format_and_count.py) utility included in the github repository.

~~~ cpp
float dst(vec p, vec* nn) {

  hit h(p);

  int data[] = {
    0x40426040,
    0x24824044,
    0xe38d2486,
    0x814a6048,
    0x42966329,
    0x632d814e,
    0x6031429e,
    0x60716331,
    0
  };

  for (uint8_t* c=(uint8_t*)data; *c; c+=2) {
    int o = c[0]>>5;
    float x = c[0]&31;
    float y = c[1]&31;
    int l = c[1]>>5;
    (o>=1&&o<=3)?seg(x,y,l*(o!=2),l*(o!=1),h):
      (o==4)?arc(v(x/2,y/2),1+0.5*(l>>2),-M_PI*((l>>1)&1),M_PI*(l&1),h):0;
  }

  if (nn) { *nn = !(p-h.pc); }
  return sqrt(h.d2)-R;

}
~~~

The above snippet (with typenames expanded for clarity) implements the
distance estimator, which iterates over each of the 16 strokes (line
segments and arcs) that comprise the text "mattz". Each stroke is
encoded in two bytes of the `data` array. The bytes include an opcode
`o` that indicates line segment or arc, `x` and `y` coordinates for
the endpoint of the line segment or center of the arc, and finally a
data argument `l` that encodes line direction and slope, or arc angle
limits.

[versions](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_0.6.cpp)
were focused on reducing the program's size. Between version 0.1 and version 0.6,
the program was modified to

 - jettison the ill-conceived templatized ray-marcher in 0.1
 - totally remove the lighting code in 0.3, and replace it entirely in 0.5
 - eliminate some unused vector class operator overloads
 - make all identifiers single characters
 - represent font bytecodes in decimal, rather than hex

Also, version 0.4 saw the the addition of comments -- I guess
groveling through all of the one-character identifiers became
sufficiently burdensome to necessitate them.[^4] By version 0.6, the program size was a
"nearly-leet" 1,342 bytes, a reduction in size of about 70% from
version 0.1x. The program output looked pretty much the same, though:

[^4]: Sadly, the comments didn't last throughout the entire program's development, which meant I needed to re-discover a large amount of program functionality while writing this post.  

![v0.6 just like 0.1 but way smaller](/images/miniray/miniray_0.6.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

This was a decent milestone -- proportional vector font in
roughly the same space as Kensler's program; however, it was past time
to do something about the basic appearance. The image has no
background at all, and none of the hallmarks (reflections, shadows)
that we have come to expect from ray tracers. To be honest, this looks like
something you might get out of WordArt, not a badass raytracer.

It was time to up my game a little bit.

Getting serious
===============

Let's talk about these version numbers for a second -- they're a
little dopey. I wasn't releasing the software to anyone (except
showing it around to a few colleagues), but I nonetheless felt it was
important to stash and label distinct versions to track how this crazy
little program was evolving. This was in the days before I was a
serious github convert, and an arbitrary numbering system was better
than no system at all.

So in any event, I declared the [next version
to be 1.0](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_1.0.cpp)
because it seemed like such a radical departure from the previous one.
It had a back wall! And a floor! And something resembling shadowing!

![v1.0 omg shadowssss](/images/miniray/miniray_1.0.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

Planes are just about the easiest primitive in the world to raymarch,
so the walls were easy enough to add. To get the shadows, I was
determined to add the ambient occlusion (AO) algorithm I had read
about in iq's presentation:

![iq explains ambient occlusion](/images/miniray/ao.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

In a nutshell, what this AO method does is to march along the normal
vector near a ray intersection and darken areas where there is lots of
other geometry nearby. It's totally fake, has no basis in reality, and
looks amazingly convincing nonetheless.

The bad news: adding the walls and all of that AO code took up lots of
program space, and there was no way to fit onto a business card
without cutting *something*. Switching to grayscale image rendering
got rid of some excess code, but the new version was
still a bit hefty, at 1,493 bytes.

By [version
1.2](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_1.2.cpp)
I had slimmed down the program to 1,461 bytes while addressing the
bland composition. Even though 1.0 looked more "ray-tracy" than 0.6
due to walls and shadows, it still didn't look very "3D" because there
was no strong perspective. I felt like the new camera pose did a much
better job showcasing the soft shadows from AO, too.

![v1.2 please put on your 3d glasses](/images/miniray/miniray_1.2.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

The program size had shrunk to 1,242 bytes by the time I got to
[version
1.4](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_1.4.cpp),
while leaving the output image nearly unchanged.
One of the big wins was replacing the font table initializer to a
character string instead of an `int` array. Here is the new,
more-compact font encoding:

~~~ cpp
  // from miniray_1.3.cpp
  u d[] = "@`B@D@\x82$\x86$\x8d\xe3H`J\x81)c\x96""BN\x81-c\x9e""B1`1cq`";
~~~

In time, I was able to compress this further by discovering an
encoding which obviated the hexidecimal escapes and quotes; meanwhile,
this was still a big improvement over the integer array.  For 1.4, I
also produced a [thoroughly commented
version](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_1.4_commented.cpp)
of this revision, which I began to show to a larger audience.

Going public
============

Sometime around September 2009, I posted a version of my program to
the now-defunct ompf.org (whose demise is lamented
[here](http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/journal-of-graphics-tools-code-repository/)
among other places), a web forum dedicated to the real-time raytracing
community. Sadly, the forum thread has been lost to the ages (the
Wayback Machine has the [forum index
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20111001013053/http://ompf.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6),
but not the thread itself), so it's a bit hard to remember which
version of the program first got posted.

My hazy recollection is that I posted something like the grayscale
image above, and got feedback along the lines of "cool idea, needs
color". A few changes enabled reducing the size enough to add RGB
color back in, including:

 - further pruning the set of vector class operator overloads
 - replacing the hit info class with a function
 - adopting a font encoding requiring fewer hexidecimal escapes and quotes

Here is the output of the new [version
2.0](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_2.0.cpp)
(I figured adding in color merited bumping the major version number):

![v2.0 oooh, color](/images/miniray/miniray_2.0.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

The color version ended up being barely larger than the smallest
grayscale version, weighing in at just 1,290 bytes. This could
definitely fit on a business card, and it looked pretty good, but it
still lacked a staple raytracing feature: reflections.

In the run-up to [version
2.4](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_2.4.cpp)
I found a few more opportunites to shave off bytes, allowing me
sufficient room to get reflections working. In the end, version 2.4
was just 1,296 bytes. The reflections in the output image are subtle, but
the downward-sloping surfaces of the letters clearly pick up some
extra white from the floor if you look closely:

![v2.4 extra shiny](/images/miniray/miniray_2.4.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

By this point, I had discovered a font encoding which was just about
as compact as theoretically possible without implementing a fully
general bitstream read across byte boundaries. It encoded the 16 strokes of
the text "mattz" in just 32 bytes of C string constant, with exactly
two bytes per stroke:

~~~ cpp
char B[]="BCJB@bJBHbJCE[FLL_A[FLMCA[CCTT`T"
~~~

A logical stopping point?
=========================

Based on feedback from ompf.org and friends, I decided to be a little
less subtle with my newly-implemented reflections. What better way to
do this than to cleave to the tried-and-true raytracing trope of the
infinite checkerboard plane?

![v3.0 let's play checkers](/images/miniray/miniray_3.0.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

Besides the plane, the new [version
3.0](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_3.0.cpp)
picked up a blue sky which hackily fades to white along the plus and
minus world $$z$$-axis, giving a hint of a sun in the sky. Amazingly,
I was able to keep the size to 1,295 bytes by:

  - eliminating a few `sqrt` calls
  - creating constants for a few commonly used quantities (like 0.5)
  - eliminating the back wall

among other changes. Here is the compacted version of the final C++
business card raytracer that got uploaded to ompf.org, probably
sometime in 2010 (the github version linked above actually has
whitespace and comments):

~~~
{: #v30}

This program seemed like the total realization of my goals for a
business card raytracer. As small as Kensler's, implementing its own
new effects (vector font, soft shadows), while still looking
absolutely "ray tracey" (checkerboard floor: check; reflections out
the wazoo: check). It amazed me that every time I thought I had
reached the absolute minimum size possible, a few more size
optimizations had occured to me. At this point, I was ready to shelve
the project as a success, and move on.

That is, until I saw the [announcement for the 20th IOCCC appear on
Slashdot.org](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/11/11/13/1546218/the-ioccc-competition-is-back).

Gearing up for IOCCC
====================

For years, I had been following the International Obfuscated C Code
Contest, or [IOCCC](http://ioccc.org/). According to the contest
organizers, its goals are:

> - To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program within the rules.
> - To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
> - To stress C compilers with unusual code.
> - To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
> - To provide a safe forum for poor C code. :-)

I'm not exactly sure when I became familiar with the IOCCC, but [Fabrice
Bellard](http://bellard.org/), a programmer I particularly admired
during grad school, won once with a [tiny C
compiler](http://ioccc.org/years.html#2001_bellard), notably producing
the first contest entry capable of compiling itself.  There had even
been a previous [tiny
raytracer](http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2004_gavare) entry
which the judges liked well enough to adopt to render an IOCCC logo:

![2004 Gavare IOCCC logo](/images/miniray/old_raytraced_logo.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

Soon after I got to grad school, the IOCCC went on hiatus. There was a
competition in 2006, but none again until the 2011 announcement linked
above. So at the long-awaited return of the contest, I realized I had
the basis for a pretty solid entry, but there was just one
problem: my program was written in C++, and the IOCCC is a C-only
competition.

What else could I do but port the entire thing to C? The 3.0 version
above is fairly C-like, but it still uses a couple of C++ language
features like constructors and operator overloading. After some
wrangling, I managed to come up with [version
4.0](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.0.c)
which produces byte-for-byte identical output to the 3.0 program
above. The program size, however, increased to 1,422 bytes.

Fortunately, the size increase wasn't particularly problematic. Moving
from a business card to the IOCCC actually opened up some headroom for
program size because the [2011 official
rules](http://www.ioccc.org/2011/rules.txt) specified[^5]

>   2) The size of your program source must be <= 4096 bytes in length.
>      The number of characters excluding whitespace (tab, space,
>      newline, formfeed, return), and excluding any ; { or } immediately
>      followed by whitespace or end of file, must be <= 2048.

[^5]: If this seems complicated, the [2013 rules](http://ioccc.org/2013/rules.txt) introduced an ["size tool"](http://www.ioccc.org/2013/iocccsize.c), a standalone C program used to compute the official length of entries.

According to this metric, the 4.0 version of my program had a "contest
length" of 1,351 bytes, leaving lots of space to add more
functionality. I decided to try something a little ambitious. Writing
a message in a proportional-width vector font inside a tiny raytracer
is pretty cool, but wouldn't it be better to be able to write *any*
message in a proportional-width vector font inside a tiny raytracer?

Going big
=========

I decided to create an *entire font* that represented a reasonable fraction of the
ASCII character set, including all of the lowercase letters, all ten
digits, and a handful of punctuation marks. Like the original "mattz"
characters, these were composed of strokes made of line segments
and arcs. To assist in this, I wrote a substantial C++ program,
[encode.cpp](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/encode.cpp),
for generating the font data. It automatically searched the space
of possible bit-level encodings of the characters to make sure
that not only was the font data string as short as possible (no
extended ASCII chars or quotes to escape), but the C expressions
used to decode it were compact as well.[^6] Here is its final output:

![letters, we got letters](/images/miniray/font.svg){: .center-image .halfwidth }

[^6]: That is, all else being equal, a binary shift right of some integer `i` by 3 bits is preferable to a shift right by 4 bits, because the former can be expressed as `i/8` and the latter must be written as `i/16` or `i>>4`, both of which are one byte longer.

After implementing [anti-aliasing via 2x2
supersampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling) as a
warm-up in [version
4.1](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.2.c),
I shoved the new font into [version
4.2](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.2.c).
Running the program with no arguments and piping output to a PPM like this:

    ./miniray_4.2 > image.ppm

would generate this image with the new default text "ioccc 2011":

![v4.2 new text for IOCCC](/images/miniray/miniray_4.2.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

but running with an additional argument like this:

    ./miniray_4.2 "your text" > image.ppm

would render the string provided on the command line, like so:

![v4.2 *any* text for IOCCC](/images/miniray/miniray_4.2_your_text.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

The final new feature for 4.2 was a preview mode. If the user
specified a second command line argument, like so:

    ./miniray_4.2 "your text" -preview > image.ppm

then the image was generated with supersampling and reflections
disabled:

![v4.2 *any* text for IOCCC, faster](/images/miniray/miniray_4.2_your_text_preview.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

This preview mode resulted in a *much* faster render time, and
although it was billed to the IOCCC judges as a feature, it also aided
development, as I could make changes to the program and not have to
wait ages (thanks to 2x2 supersampling) to see if I had completely
broken the renderer.

The code had gotten much more complex, as it now had to:

 - count command line arguments to decide which text to display
 - look up the glyph for each text character and 
   arrange the strokes in each glyph into the scene
 - support two different rendering modes

Despite all of that, version 4.2 still fit into the contest
requirements, with a total program size of 2,058 bytes and a contest
length of just 1,982, still under the 2,048 byte limit. Incidentally,
this is the version of the source code where comments were totally
abandoned. I think it was just too hard to keep detailed explanations
in place as I kept transforming the program.

I was pretty sure I had a solid IOCCC contender, but I felt it could
bear some additional obfuscation. 

Increasing inscrutability
=========================

My next goal was to make it not just difficult, but nigh-impossible
for a competent C programmer to interpret the program. Versions
[4.3](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.3.c)
[through](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.4.c)
[4.5](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.5.c)
went a long way towards accomplishing this by

 - eliminating *all* local variables -- every variable is either a program global or a function argument.
 - undertaking major re-organizations to shorten the code -- throughout this project I consistently found the shorter the program, the more impenetrable.
 - tweaking the encoding a bit more, and hoisting the PPM header `"P6 600 220 255"` into the giant unreadable string at the top of the file.
 - eliminating all control flow structures aside from `for` and the ternary operator `?:`.
 - abusing the hell out of the comma operator to cram multiple statements inside `for` loop initializers, conditions, and counters.

Along the way, I also tweaked the camera parameters and deepened the
shadow intensity, which provided better contrast where the letters met
the ground, as shown here:

![v4.5 deeper shadows](/images/miniray/miniray_4.5.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

When I was reading over version 4.5 this week, I was amused
to encounter this comment:

~~~ cpp
/*
  _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
   iiivc fvfccfFiivfivif fttiFvvFPiFffcvivvFvFiPiFFvifv
   *                          *               
  */
~~~

...written to help me remember which identifiers had which
data types. Capital `F` is for function, lowercase `f` for float, `i`
int, etc.  I don't recall what the asterisks in the bottom row are
for, but it is notable that there are only three valid one-character
identifiers left! I also hid a cat in the definition of the 3D vector
struct:

~~~ cpp
typedef struct { x c,a,t; } y;
~~~

I'm pretty sure that 4.5 was the version initially submitted to the
IOCCC; however, the contest judges found a few characters (`"`, `:`,
and `/`) which caused rendering artifacts. The final modification
(from 4.5 to
[4.6](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.6.c))
was just a bugfix to correct the issue. Without any fancy layout, the
final version came in at 1,870 bytes with a contest length
of 1,808; however, with some insertion of additional whitespace and
formatting, the [final
submission](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/zucker.c)
still fit comfortably under the size limit, and looked like this:

It's supposed to represent a canonical raytracing diagram, where an
incident ray with direction $$D$$ hits a surface with normal $$N$$ and
reflects in direction $$R$$.

Victory and aftermath
=====================

On February 2, 2012, I was ecstatic to receive an email with the
subject line **IOCCC 2011: Your program has won the 20th ICCCC.** My
little raytracer would join the other entries on the [Previous IOCCC
winners](http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2011_zucker) page. Clearly,
the final round of obfucsations had impressed the judges, [who
incredulously noted](http://www.ioccc.org/2011/zucker/hint.html):

> This entry uses no local variables. None! At! All!

They also used the program to render a logo graphic for the [IOCCC
webpage](http://ioccc.org/), where it has remained to this day (no doubt to be replaced as
soon as someone develops an even cooler obfuscated graphics program
that spells out the contest name, I suppose). Here's a current screenshot:

![IOCCC webpage screenshot](/images/miniray/ioccc-screenshot.png){: .center-image}

Looking back, this IOCCC entry is probably my favorite program I've
ever written. It just packs so much *stuff* into such a tiny and
inscrutable space, and its output looks both fun and tangible, like a
shiny sculpture you'd want to touch. Furthermore, being an IOCCC
winner has helped me build up a healthy stockpile of programmer cred
with my colleagues.

Just this week, in preparation for this blog entry, I ended up
producing a [heavily commented version of the final 4.6
code](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_4.6_commented.c). It
took me hours to finish -- after nearly five years, I had forgotten
exactly how gnarly the program is. I *wrote* the dang thing, and even
I was having trouble analyzing all of the re-used global variables, comma
operators, and nested ternary operators. Annotating the program
definitely made me appreciate how nuts I was do write it in the first
place.

I remember enjoying writing up the tongue-in-cheek [author's comments
to accompany the entry](http://www.ioccc.org/2011/zucker/hint.html),
and I've definitely enjoyed writing up this more thorough
retrospective of the project as well. So, thanks to the IOCCC
organizers for "providing a safe forum for poor C code"!

Postscript: printed card design {#card}
===============================

*Update Aug 17, 2016:* Working on this post finally prompted me to get
business cards printed with the program on the back. After a few extra
tweaks, I came up with a C++ edition that fits really nicely on a
standard 3.5"x2" business card. Here it is, front and back:

![card final version](/images/miniray/card_front_back.png){: .center-image }

The URL in the top right points to this page, of course. The code produces this image:

![card final version](/images/miniray/miniray_3.1.png){: .center-image .halfwidth }

What's printed is
[version 3.1](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/miniray_3.1.cpp),
with a bit of
[extra formatting](https://github.com/mzucker/miniray/blob/master/src/card.cpp).
Reducing the size from [3.0](#v30) involved changing a couple `while`
statements to `for` statements, replacing `if` with `?:`, and
aggressively removing parentheses and brackets. To eliminate the
whitespace at the top, I had to get rid of some preprocessor
directives -- this involved manually declaring functions from
`<math.h>`, a dirty move that I am nonetheless particularly proud of.
I also back-ported the increased shadow intensity from 4.3, which I
thought looked nicer.

The cards have been ordered and should arrive before September!

*Update Aug 24, 2016:* The cards have arrived -- here's the actual,
 tangible, meatspace version:
 
![in meatspace](/images/miniray/actual_card.jpg){: .center-image }

[MOO.com](https://MOO.com) did a great job with the print, would order
from them again. They are sturdy and vibrant, the only minor issue is
the cardstock feels a bit slick on both sides despite the matte
finish. Next time I might choose one rung higher on the menu of
finishing options (I selected the lowest one).
