title: Watertight vector maps from raster images
---

Or, "how not to GIS".

For the impatient, there's a
[github repository](https://github.com/mzucker/maptrace) for the
`maptrace` program documented here, and it comes complete with example
[inputs](https://github.com/mzucker/maptrace/tree/master/images) and
[outputs](https://github.com/mzucker/maptrace/tree/master/examples)
for quick perusal.


## Introduction

From time to time, I moonlight as a
[graphic designer](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1018866-graphic-design-is-my-passion)
and one of the infrequent tasks I take on in this role is helping
people clean up geographic maps for presentation and publication. 
One recent project involved illustrating the locations of speakers of
various languages based on data from
[SIL International](https://www.sil.org/). Here's the resulting map as a PNG file (downsampled 8X from the original size):

![1/8 size original input map](/images/maptrace/birds-head-small.png){: .center-threequarters .border}

The *right* way to accomplish this would have been to fire up
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) or other actual [GIS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), and create a
set of [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)
corresponding to the geographic regions of interest. But since my
"client"[^1] was under a time crunch, we settled on tracing over an
existing map in Photoshop and filling in regions by hand with the
Paint Bucket tool. Yes, this was a gross solution but it got the
publication out on time, and the client is currently working on a
proper GIS representation.[^2]

[^1]: Who also happens to be my wife.
[^2]: Or at least, paying an undergrad RA to work on a proper GIS solution.

In the meantime, the client wanted to generate a few alternative color
schemes to highlight particular regions for another presentation (once
again on a fairly rapid timetable) and I thought it would be a much
easier task to accomplish in Illustrator rather than Photoshop, since
vector graphics are much easier to work with when it comes to
selecting colors for flat regions.

So I wrote a program to take the original map and convert it to a
[scalable vector graphics (SVG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
file that can be easily imported into Illustrator. It ended up working
out really nicely -- here's the final output (click to enlarge):

[![vector output](/images/maptrace/birds-head.svg){: .center-threequarters .border }](/images/maptrace/birds-head.svg)

Let's take a look at a few details from the two images. For each of
these, the left-hand side comes from the original quick-and-dirty
Photoshop output, and the right-hand side comes from rasterizing the
SVG output of the program. You can see lots of tiny fringing artifacts
from using the Paint Bucket tool to flood-fill regions in the
original; they are completely gone in the vector output.

![comparison 1/3](/images/maptrace/birds-head-comparison1.png){: .center-image }

![comparison 2/3](/images/maptrace/birds-head-comparison2.png){: .center-image }

![comparison 3/3](/images/maptrace/birds-head-comparison3.png){: .center-image }

The SVG file affords a good deal of compression, too: the original PNG weighs in
at about 2.5M (reduced to 1.0M when lossily compressed by
[`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org/)). In contrast, the output SVG is
105K but just 38K when
[gzip-compressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics#Compression).

**So not only does it look a lot nicer, the final output is about 25X
*smaller* than the original!**   
(Hmm, reminds me of [my noteshrink project]({% post_url 2016-09-20-noteshrink %})...)

## Caveats

You should carefully consider whether `maptrace` is the right tool
for you!

First of all, it's always better to use original
georeferenced data if it's available. Second, this is an incomplete
system from a GIS standpoint because it doesn't produce
[georeferenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing)
output. If your input data is georeferenced, you will lose all of this
information when the program is run. 

Finally, please **do not use this
software to circumvent copyright restrictions on existing maps!** For
the purposes of copyright, you should consider the output of
`maptrace` a derivative work of the original input. So, only publish 
`maptrace` output if you are licensed to reproduce the original input.

## Producing watertight vector maps

There already exist tools to automatically convert raster (bitmap)
images to vector formats, including Adobe Illustrator's
[Live Trace](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/tracing-artwork-live-trace-or.html)/[Image Trace](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/image-trace.html)
tools or standalone programs like Peter Selinger's [`potrace`](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/), which provides the [comparable functionality in Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/tracing/tutorial-tracing.html).

However, all of these tools share a common shortcoming from the
perspective of mapmaking -- given a simple raster line drawing like
this heart:

![a scribbly heart outline](/images/maptrace/heart.png){: .center-image .border }

...they actually produce *two* contours, one for the inside, and one for
the outside. You can demonstrate this by re-coloring the output of
`potrace` to stroke each contour:

![heart interior, border, interior](/images/maptrace/heart-potrace.svg){: .center-image .border }

What we would prefer is to replace the outline with a single contour that can be stroked
to any desired width. Here's the output from my `maptrace` tool:

![heart interior, border, interior](/images/maptrace/heart-maptrace.svg){: .center-image .border }

In actuality, `maptrace` also produces two contours surrounding the
heart (corresponding to the borders of the light and dark regions
above); however, they overlap completely, allowing the user to stroke
the border to whatever width they please.

Borrowing from the 3D modeling community, I'm going to refer to this
property of completely overlapping outlines as a *watertight* map,
since the boundary of each map region (i.e. the interior and exterior
of the heart above) is completely coincident with its neighbor,
leaving no gaps. Producing watertight maps was my main technical
objective in undertaking this project.

### Related efforts

As I was reading up when getting organized to write this post, I ran across
a couple of related efforts:

 - **<https://cscott.net/Projects/Mallard/>** -- automatic generation of stained glass from photos, very similar goals and techniques
 
 - **<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:TomChance/VectorisingStreetView>** -- generating building outlines from raster data (no outlines, though)
 
 - **<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapseg>** -- OpenStreetMap tool for segmenting maps, not sure how it deals with outlines
 
I'm sure this is an incomplete list, and there's probably lots more interesting related work out there.


## How it works

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how `maptrace` goes from a raster input to an output SVG.

### 1. Outline detection 

First, the input image is
[thresholded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing))
to convert the original grayscale or RGB image into a 1-bpp boolean
mask indicating where outlines are found. The resulting mask is nonzero
wherever the *maximum* of the red, green, or blue channels exceeds a
brightness threshold, OR wherever the alpha channel falls below some
opacity threshold (e.g., we assume transparent areas are not map
outlines).

Let's illustrate on this hastily drawn grayscale yin-yang symbol image:

![input yin-yang symbol](/images/maptrace/demo.png){: .center-image .border}

The mask produced by the thresholding operation is zero wherever the
yin-yang outline falls, and one everywhere else:

![thresholded yin-yang symbol](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_mask.png){: .center-image .border}

Next, we can optionally apply
[morphological operators](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci773s1c/lectures/ImageProcessing-html/topic4.htm)
such as erosion, dilation, opening, or closing to the mask image. This
can be useful to dam small gaps in the outlines or join nearby
regions separated by very small bits of outline. We're going to omit
this step for the yin-yang example, but see the
[README.md in the github repository](https://github.com/mzucker/maptrace#examples)
for examples (look for the `-f` command-line option).

### 2. Connected component analysis

Now we take the mask computed above and perform
[connected-component labeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling)
to identify the unique non-outline regions within the image. In our
yin-yang example, there are five regions, each assigned a random color
here (the outline itself is left white):

![colored, non-outline regions of yin-yang symbol](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_regions.png){: .center-image .border}

Our next step is to reduce the outline to a zero-thickness boundary.

### 3. Growing non-outline regions

We now obtain the
[Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/distance.htm)
of the mask image. The EDT computes the distance from every outline
pixel to the closest non-outline pixel. Here is a visualization
(brighter pixels are embedded further inside the outline):

![EDT of mask](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_dist.png){: .center-image .border}

For our application of the EDT, we don't care about the distances
themselves; we are actually far more interested in the label of the
closest non-outline pixel. When each outline pixel is assigned this
label, the non-outline regions grow, and we obtain a map with no gaps
between them at all:

![expanded regions with no outline](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_regions_expanded.png){: .center-image .border}

Now it's time to stop working with rasters and begin representing the image as a set of vector outlines.

### 4. Tracing borders between regions

Next, we trace along the outline of each labeled region (as well as
the borders of the image) to create a set of nodes and edges. Each
edge is a sequence of steps along the boundaries of pixels bordering
two distinct regions, and the nodes are their intersection points (or
arbitrary points along closed edges). 

The SVG figure below shows the nodes as black circles and the edges as
dotted lines whose colors indicate the labeled regions they border:

![nodes and edges](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_brep.svg){: .center-image .border}

This tracing operation is by far the slowest part
of the program, since it's all done with naïve loops in Python.  It's
theoretically possible to speed this operation up by parallelizing it or
calling out to [`Cython`](http://cython.org/) but I'd probably rather port
the entire program to a compiled langauge eventually instead.


### 5. Simplification 

Next, we can optionally merge nearby nodes and then apply the
[Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm)
to simplify each edge, with user-supplied tolerances. This is
useful for eliminating the little square jaggies that result from
following pixel-aligned paths. The results look like this:

![simplified nodes and edges](/images/maptrace/demo_debug_brep_simplified.svg){: .center-image .border}

### 6. SVG output

Finally, we generate the output SVG. For each labeled region, we loop
over the edges that border it and concatenate them into one or more
contours.[^3] We can assign random colors per region (as we have done so
far in this example), pull colors in from the original image, or even
assign them from another image of the same size and shape.

[^3]: Note that regions with holes will necessarily be formed by more than one contour.

As a command-line option, we can tell the program to stroke the
largest region (usually the background or ocean) with a larger
outline, which often looks quite nice. Here's the final output SVG for
our yin-yang symbol example:

![yin-yang final output](/images/maptrace/demo.svg){: .center-image .border}

Here's another example pulled from the github repository. The Original
input image is the 2012 electoral map for Pennsylvania, pulled from
[Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pennsylvania-2012_presidential_election-by_county.PNG):

![PA 2012 electoral map PNG](/images/maptrace/pa-2012-pres.png){: .center-image .border}

...and here's the `maptrace` output as an SVG file:

![PA 2012 electoral map PNG](/images/maptrace/pa-2012-pres.svg){: .center-image .border}

## Cool tricks & future work

After connected component labeling but before region growing, we can
optionally delete very small regions whose areas fall below a certain
threshold.  This is nice for getting rid of single-pixel blips, but
can also be used to remove text from maps, as in this US Census Bureau
map of Pennsylvania counties, also taken from
[Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Census_Bureau_Pennsylvania_County_Map.png):

[![US Census PA counties map](/images/maptrace/pa-counties.png)](/images/maptrace/pa-counties.png){: .center-threequarters .border}

Here's the resulting SVG file after deleting any enclosed region whose area is under 1000 pixels:

[![US Census PA counties map](/images/maptrace/pa-counties.svg)](/images/maptrace/pa-counties.svg){: .center-threequarters .border}

Magic, right?[^4]

[^4]: Exercise for the reader: why do the little lines along the border of the state get deleted?

One area where `potrace` and its commercial analogues significantly
outperform `maptrace` is in their ability to recognize and output
curved paths. In contrast, every vector output by my program is
polygonal. They look fine when zoomed out, but don't look great at low
resolution. Let's call that future work.

Additionally, since it's written in Python, `maptrace` is much slower
than an optimized implementation in a compiled language would be. Not
sure when I'll get around to it, but I've been meaning to try out
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) for a while, maybe I'll take a crack at
porting it someday...

Anyways, that's about it for now. Feel free to follow up on twitter
with any questions or comments you might have!
